EMC measures,Objective
Do not route fieldbus cables and signal wires in a single cable duct,Reduces mutual interference
together with lines with DC and AC voltages of more than 60 V.,
"(Fieldbus cables, signal lines and analog lines may be in the same",
cable duct),
Use separate cable ducts at least 20 cm (7.87 in) apart.,
Keep cables as short as possible. Do not install unnecessary,Reduces capacitive and
"cable loops, use short cables from the central grounding point in",inductive interference.
the control cabinet to the external ground connection.,
Use equipotential bonding conductors in the following cases:,Reduces current in the cable
"wide-area installations, different voltage supplies and installation","shield, reduces emissions."
across several buildings.,
Use fine stranded equipotential bonding conductors.,Diverts high-frequency
,interference currents.
"If motor and machine are not conductively connected, for example","Reduces emissions, increases"
"by an insulated flange or a connection without surface contact,",immunity.
you must ground the motor with a ground strap or a ground wire.,
The conductor cross section must be at least 10 mm2 (AWG 6).,
Use twisted pair for the DC supply.,Reduces interference affecting
,"the signal cables, reduces"
,emissions.
