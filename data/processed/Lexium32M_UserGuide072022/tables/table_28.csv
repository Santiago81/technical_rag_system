"(1) As per IEC 60269. Circuit breakers with B or C characteristic. See Conditions for UL 508C and CSA, page 56. Lower ratings arepermissible. The fuse must be rated in such a way that the fuse does not trip at the specified input current.(2) At a mains impedance corresponding to a short-circuit current of the supply mains of 5 kA (for LXM32MU60, LXM32MD12,LXM32MD18, LXM32MD30 and LXM32MD72) and of 22 kA (for LXM32MD85 and LXM32MC10)(3) At nominal power and nominal voltage.(4) With reference to the input current.(5) Condition: internal braking resistor not active. Value at nominal current, nominal voltage and nominal power. Value approximatelyproportional with output current.(6) Extreme case, off/on pulse before the inrush current limitation responds, see next line for maximum time.",,,,,,,,
