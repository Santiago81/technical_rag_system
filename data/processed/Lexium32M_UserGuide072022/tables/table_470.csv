"Errorcode(hex)","Errorclass",Description,Cause,Correctives
A33C,0,"Function not available in thisoperating modeParameter _WarnLatched Bit 4","Activation of a function which is notavailable in the active operatingmode.Example: Start of backlashcompensation while autotuning/manual tuning is active.",-
A33D,0,"Motion blend is already activeParameter _WarnLatched Bit 4","Change of motion blend during theongoing motion blend (end positionof motion blend not yet reached)","Wait for the motion blend to completebefore setting the next position."
A33E,0,"No movement activatedParameter _WarnLatched Bit 4","Activation of a motion blend withoutmovement.","Start a movement before the motionblend is activated."
A33F,0,"Position of motion blend movementnot in the range of the ongoingmovementParameter _WarnLatched Bit 4","The position of the motion blend isoutside of the movement range.","Verify the position of the motion blendand the movement range."
A340,1,"Error detected in operating modeMotion Sequence. Additionalinformation in the error memoryindicates the detailed error code.Parameter _SigLatched Bit 4","The operating mode MotionSequence was stopped in responseto a detected error. Verify the errormemory for details on the detectederror.",See the additional error information.
A341,0,"Position of motion blend has alreadybeen passedParameter _WarnLatched Bit 4","The movement has passed beyondthe position of the motion blend.",-
A342,1,"Target velocity was not reached atmotion blend position.Parameter _SigLatched Bit 4","The position of the motion blend wasovertraveled, the target velocity wasnot reached.","Reduce the ramp velocity so that thetarget velocity is reached at theposition of the motion blend."
A343,0,"Processing only possible with linearrampParameter _WarnLatched Bit 4","Motion blend position was set with anon-linear ramp.",Set a linear ramp.
A344,par.,"Maximum position deviation betweenmotor encoder and machine encoderexceededParameter _SigLatched Bit 8","Incorrect or inoperative encodercable.Machine encoder not connected ornot supplied correctly.Different counting directions of motorencoder and machine encoder.Incorrect setting of resolution factors(numerator or denominator) ofmachine encoder.","Verify encoder connection.Verify parameterization of machineencoder."
A347,0,"Permissible position deviationexceededParameter _WarnLatched Bit 8","External load or acceleration are toohigh.","Reduce external load or acceleration.Threshold value can be adjusted viathe parameter MON_p_dif_warn."

A349,0,"Position setting exceeds systemlimits","Position scaling of POSscaleDenomand POSscaleNum results in ascaling factor that is too small.","Change POSscaleDenom andPOSscaleNum in such a way as toincrease the resulting scaling factor."
A34A,0,"Velocity setting exceeds systemlimits","The velocity scaling of'VELscaleDenom' and'VELscaleNum' results in a scalingfactor that is too small.The velocity has been set to a valuegreater than the maximum possiblevelocity (the maximum velocity is13200 RPM).","Change 'VELscaleDenom' and'VELscaleNum' in such a way as toincrease the resulting scaling factor."
