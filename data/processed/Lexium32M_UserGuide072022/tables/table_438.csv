Additional information inthe error memory indicates theModbus register address.","During a configuration download, oneor more configuration values werenot accepted by the drive.","Verify that the configuration file isvalid and matches the type andversion of the drive. The value in theadditional error info shows theModbus register address of theparameter where the initializationerror was detected."

An error was detectedduring the recalculation.","Power the drive off and on again.This may help you to identify theaffected parameter(s). Change theparameters as required. Verify thatthe parameter configuration is validbefore starting the recalculationprocedure."
111E,1,Not possible to recalculate data set,"A data set of the operating modeMotion Sequence could not berecalculated.","The address of the parameter andthe number of the data set thatcaused this condition can be read viathe parameter _PAR_ScalingError."
