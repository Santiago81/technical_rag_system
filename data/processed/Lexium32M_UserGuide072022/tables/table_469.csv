A32C,1,"Reference switch error detected(switch signal briefly enabled orswitch overtraveled)Parameter _SigLatched Bit 4","Switch signal disturbance.Motor subjected to vibration or shockwhen stopped after activation of theswitch signal.","Verify supply voltage, cabling andfunction of switch.Verify motor response after stoppingand optimize control loop settings."
A32D,1,"Positive limit switch error detected(switch signal briefly enabled orswitch overtraveled)Parameter _SigLatched Bit 4","Switch signal disturbance.Motor subjected to vibration or shockwhen stopped after activation of theswitch signal.","Verify supply voltage, cabling andfunction of switch.Verify motor response after stoppingand optimize control loop settings."
A32E,1,"Negative limit switch error detected(switch signal briefly enabled orswitch overtraveled)Parameter _SigLatched Bit 4","Switch signal disturbance.Motor subjected to vibration or shockwhen stopped after activation of theswitch signal.","Verify supply voltage, cabling andfunction of switch.Verify motor response after stoppingand optimize control loop settings."
A32F,1,"Index pulse not foundParameter _SigLatched Bit 4","Index pulse signal not connected ornot working properly.","Verify index pulse signal andconnection."
A330,0,"Reference movement to index pulsecannot be reproduced. Index pulse istoo close to the switchParameter _WarnLatched Bit 4","The position difference between theindex pulse and the switching point isinsufficient.","Increase the distance between theindex pulse and the switching point. Ifpossible, the distance between theindex pulse and the switching pointshould be a half motor revolution."
A332,1,"Jog error detected. Additionalinformation in the error memoryindicates the detailed error code.Parameter _SigLatched Bit 4","Jog movement was stopped inresponse to a detected error.","For additional info, verify the detailederror code in the error memory."
A333,3,"System error detected: Invalidinternal selection",-,-
A334,2,"Timeout Standstill Windowmonitoring","Position deviation after movementgreater than standstill window. Thismay have been caused by anexternal load.","Verify load.Verify settings for standstill window(parameter MON_p_win, MON_p_winTime and MON_p_winTout).Optimize control loop settings."
