A31C,0,"Invalid position setting with softwarelimit switch","Value for negative (positive) softwarelimit switch is greater (less) thanvalue for positive (negative) softwarelimit switch.",Set correct position values.
A31D,0,"Velocity range exceeded (parameterCTRL_v_max, M_n_max)","The velocity was set to a valuegreater than the maximumpermissible velocity in parameterCTRL_v_max or M_n_max,whichever is lower.","If the value of parameter M_n_max isgreater than the value of parameterCTRL_v_max, increase the value ofparameter CTRL_v_max or reducethe velocity value."
A31E,1,"Stop by positive software limit switchParameter _SigLatched Bit 2","Not possible to execute commandbecause positive software limit switchwas triggered.","Return to the permissible movementrange."
A31F,1,"Stop by negative software limit switchParameter _SigLatched Bit 2","Not possible to execute commandbecause negative software limitswitch was triggered.","Return to the permissible movementrange."
A320,par.,"Permissible position deviationexceededParameter _SigLatched Bit 8","External load or acceleration are toohigh.","Reduce external load or acceleration.Use a differently rated drive, ifnecessary.Error response can be adjusted viaparameter ErrorResp_p_dif."
