EMC measures,Objective
"Do not install switching elements in motor cables or encodercables.",Reduces interference.
"Route the motor cable at a distance of at least 20 cm (7.87 in)from the signal cable or use shielding plates between the motorcable and signal cable.",Reduces mutual interference
"For long lines, use equipotential bonding conductors.","Reduces current in the cableshield."
Route the motor cable and encoder cable without cutting them.(1),Reduces emission.
"(1) If a cable has to be cut for the installation, it has to be connected with shield connections and ametal housing at the point of the cut.",
