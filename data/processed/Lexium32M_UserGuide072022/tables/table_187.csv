AT_dis_usr,"Movement range for Autotuning.Movement range within which the controlparameters are automatically optimized. Themovement range is entered with reference to theactual position.In the case of ""Movement in one direction only""(Parameter AT_dir), the specified range is usedfor each optimization step. The movementtypically corresponds to 20 times the value, but itis not limited.The minimum value, the factory setting and themaximum value depend on the scaling factor.Modified settings become active the next time themotor moves.Available with firmware version ≥V01.03.","usr_p1327682147483647","INT32R/W--","CANopen 302F:12hModbus 12068Profibus 12068CIP 147.1.18ModbusTCP 12068EtherCAT 302F:12hPROFINET 12068"
