A34B,0,Ramp setting exceeds system limits,"The ramp scaling of'RAMPscaleDenom' and'RAMPscaleNum' results in a scalingfactor that is too small.","Change of 'RAMPscaleDenom' and'RAMPscaleNum' in such a way as toincrease the resulting scaling factor."
A34C,0,"Resolution of scaling too high (rangeexceeded)",-,-
A34D,0,"Function not available when Modulois active","The function cannot be executedwhen Modulo is active.","Deactivate Modulo to use thefunction."
A34E,0,"Target value for absolute movementnot possible with defined modulorange and modulo handling.","If parameter 'MOD_Absolute' is setto:Shortest Distance: Target value is notin defined modulo range.Positive Direction: Target value isless than parameter 'MOD_Min'.Negative Direction: Target value isgreater than parameter 'MOD_Max'.","Set a correct target value for absolutemovement."
A34F,0,"Target position outside of modulorange. Corresponding movementwithin range performed instead.","The setting of parameter 'MOD_AbsMultiRng' only allows for amovement within the modulo range.","Change the parameter 'MOD_AbsMultiRng' to allow for movementsbeyond the modulo range."
A350,1,"Change for jerk filter input positiontoo greatParameter _SigLatched Bit 4","Operating mode Electronic Gear withprocessing method 'Positionsynchronization with compensationmovement' has been activated whichresulted in a position change greaterthan 0.25 revolutions.","Deactivate jerk filter processing forElectronic Gear or use processingmethod 'Position synchronizationwithout compensation movement'."
A351,1,"Function cannot be executed withthis position scaling factorParameter _SigLatched Bit 4","The positions scaling factor is set to avalue less than 1rev/131072usr_p,which is less than the internalresolution.In the operating mode CyclicSynchronous Position, the resolutionis not set to 1rev/131072usr_p.","Use a different position scaling factoror deactivate the selected function."
