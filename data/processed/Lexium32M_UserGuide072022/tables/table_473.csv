"Errorcode(hex)","Errorclass",Description,Cause,Correctives
B122,2,"Cyclic communication: IncorrectsynchronizationParameter _SigLatched Bit 21","One signal was missing and theexpected second signal was receivedat an incorrect point in time. Themaster controller may be unable toprovide the required synchronizationsignals at the set cycle time, forexample, due to insufficientcomputing power.","Analyze the communication orincrease the cycle time."
B123,2,"Cyclic communication: The selectedcycle time tolerance is too highParameter _SigLatched Bit 21","The cycle time tolerance may notexceed one quarter of the set cycletime.",Enter a correct value.
B124,0,"Cyclic Communication: Drive is notsynchronous with master cycleParameter _WarnLatched Bit 21","Operating mode has been activatedbut drive is not synchronized toexternal synchronization signal.","After having started thesynchronization mechanism, wait for120 cycles before activating theoperating mode."
B200,0,"RS485/Modbus: Protocol errordetectedParameter _WarnLatched Bit 5","Logical protocol error detected:Incorrect length or unsupportedsubfunction.","Verify application on the Modbusmaster."
B201,2,"RS485/Modbus: Interruption of theconnectionParameter _SigLatched Bit 5","Connection monitoring has detectedan interruption of the connection.","Verify all connections and cablesused for data exchange. Verify thatthe device is on."
B202,0,"RS485/Modbus: Interruption of theconnectionParameter _WarnLatched Bit 5","Connection monitoring has detectedan interruption of the connection.","Verify all connections and cablesused for data exchange. Verify thatthe device is on."
B203,0,"RS485/Modbus: Incorrect number ofmonitor objectsParameter _WarnLatched Bit 5",-,-
B312,2,"Profibus: Clear command with errorresponseParameter _SigLatched Bit 21","Clear command sent by master,detected bus error.",Verify the application.
B314,2,"Watchdog error with error responseParameter _SigLatched Bit 21","The bus cycle time is greater than theprogrammed watchdog time.",Increase watchdog time.
B316,2,"Communication error detected witherror responseParameter _SigLatched Bit 21","Detected system or bus error, EMI.","Verify fieldbus connection, shieldconnection."
B400,2,"CANopen: NMT reset with powerstage enabledParameter _SigLatched Bit 21","NMT Reset command is receivedwhile drive is in operating stateOperation Enabled.","Disable the power stage beforesending a NMT reset command."
B401,2,"CANopen: NMT stop with powerstage enabledParameter _SigLatched Bit 21","NMT Stop command is receivedwhile drive is in operating stateOperation Enabled.","Disable the power stage beforesending a NMT Stop command."
B402,0,"CAN PLL activeParameter _WarnLatched Bit 21","An attempt has been made to startthe synchronization mechanism, butthe synchronization mechanism wasalready active.","Deactivate the synchronizationmechanism."
B403,2,"Excessive Sync period deviationParameter _SigLatched Bit 21","The period time of the SYNC signalsis not stable. The deviation is morethan 100 usec.","The SYNC signals of the motioncontroller must be more accurate."
B404,2,"Sync signal error detectedParameter _SigLatched Bit 21","SYNC signal missed more thantwice.","Verify CAN connection, verify motioncontroller."
B405,2,"Drive could not be adapted to mastercycleParameter _SigLatched Bit 21","The jitter of the SYNC object is toogreat or the motion bus requirementsare not taken into account.","Verify the timing requirementsregarding interpolation time periodand number of devices."
