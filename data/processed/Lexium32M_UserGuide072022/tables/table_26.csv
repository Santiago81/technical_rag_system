"(1) As per IEC 60269. Circuit breakers with B or C characteristic. See Conditions for UL 508C and CSA, page 56. Lower ratings arepermissible. The fuse must be rated in such a way that the fuse does not trip at the specified input current.(2) At a mains impedance corresponding to a short-circuit current of the supply mains of 1 kA.(3) At nominal power and nominal voltage.(4) With reference to the input current.(5) Condition: internal braking resistor not active. Value at nominal current, nominal voltage and nominal power. Value approximatelyproportional with output current.(6) Extreme case, off/on pulse before the inrush current limitation responds, see next line for maximum time.",,,,,
