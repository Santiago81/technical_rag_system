,A new scaling is activated when the numerator,,,EtherCAT 3006:22h
,value is supplied.,,,

,1 / On: Shifting on,0,per.,Profibus 1346
,"After activating the shifting function, the position",1,-,CIP 105.1.33
,range of a multiturn encoder is shifted by one half,,,
,of the range.,,,ModbusTCP 1346
,Example for the position range of a multiturn,,,EtherCAT 3005:21h
,encoder with 4096 revolutions:,,,
,,,,PROFINET 1346
,Value 0: Position values are between 0 ... 4096,,,
,revolutions.,,,
,Value 1: Position values are between -2048 ...,,,
,2048 revolutions.,,,

,position after power cycling,1,-,CIP 105.1.35
,This parameter specifies the way position values,,,ModbusTCP 1350
,are handled over a power cycle and allows for the,,,
,simulation of an absolute position encoder using,,,EtherCAT 3005:23h
,singleturn encoders.,,,
,,,,PROFINET 1350
,"If this function is activated, the drive saves the",,,
,pertinent position data prior to a power removal so,,,
,that the drive can restore the mechanical position,,,
,the next time it is powered on.,,,
,"In the case of singleturn encoders, the position",,,
,can be restored if the motor shaft has not been,,,
,moved by more than 0.25 revolutions while the,,,
,drive was powered off.,,,
,"In the case of multiturn encoders, the permissible",,,
,shaft movement while the drive is off can be much,,,
,"greater, depending on the type of multiturn",,,
,encoder.,,,
,"For this function to work, the drive may only be",,,
,powered off while the motor is at a standstill and,,,
,the motor shaft must not be moved outside of the,,,
,"permissible range (for example, use a holding",,,
,brake).,,,
,Modified settings become active immediately.,,,
