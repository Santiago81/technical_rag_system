,AX5021-0000-0000,Using a brake module allows to take up additional braking power
,,in a drive system. For drives up to the size of the AX5125 (25 A
,,rated current) it is not permissible to connect the DC busses and
,,an external brake resistor at the same time. A further advantage
,,is the simple installation and the small space requirement of the
,,brake module. The brake module is equipped with a complete
,,DC link and an internal brake resistor and enables the
,,connection of an external brake resistor with the integrated
,,brake chopper. Several brake modules can be integrated into a
,,drive system.
