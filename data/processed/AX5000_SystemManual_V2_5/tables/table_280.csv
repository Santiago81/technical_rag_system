Activation,0: manual,"Selection of when the commutation processis started"
Static current vector,,Commutation methods
Current level,Stationary current in %,"Current intensity of the current vector (value= 100% x P0-0093 / P0-0092)"
Duration,3000 ms,"Period for which the parameterized currentis maintained so that any oscillations thatmay be present can settle, allowing anoptimum commutation angle to be reached"
Wake and shake,,Commutation methods
First phase current vector,Stationary current in %,"Current intensity of the current vector(value = 100% x P0-0093 / P0-0092)"
First phase ramp up time,100 ms,"Time for the current vector ""a"" to reachits parameterized magnitude"
Second phase current level,Stationary current in %,"Current intensity of the current vector(value = 100% x P0-0093 / P0-0092)"
Second phase ramp up time,500 ms,"Time for the current vector ""g"" to reach itsparameterized magnitude"
Commutation pos control: Kp,0.04,"Amplification factor. Attention: If ""0"" thenVariant 2 will be carried out in Phase 2"
Wake and shake expert,,"Attention: Only experienced users shouldchange the following parameters!"
First phase pos monitoring limit,0.5 degrees,"Minimum angle of rotation of the rotorrequired to detect movement"
First phase step width,22.5 degrees,"Current vector offset or segmentdetection angle"
First phase waiting time after step,150 ms,"The time from detection of movementand the next step in Phase 1 or betweenPhase 1 and Phase 2 (any oscillations inthe system have time to settle)"
Second phase duration,3000 ms,"Period for which the parameterizedcurrent is maintained so that anyoscillations that may be present can settle,allowing an optimum commutation angle tobe reached"
Error monitoring (range of motion),90 degrees,"The maximum movement of the rotorbefore it is switched off, since there wouldotherwise be a risk that the motor wouldmake an uncontrolled movement."
