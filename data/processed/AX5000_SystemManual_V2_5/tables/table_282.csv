Parameter,Default,Possible causes that might require a
,,change in the default value
First phase current level,Stationary current in %,"Sluggish system,"
,,high attenuation --> increase value
,,"Smooth system,"
,,low attenuation --> reduce value
First phase ramp up time,100 ms,"Sluggish system,"
,,high attenuation --> increase value
,,"Smooth system,"
,,low attenuation --> reduce value
First phase pos monitoring limit,0.5 degrees,Application only permits very limited
,,uncontrolled changes in the movement
,,--> reduce value
,,The system has a small amount of
,,attenuation
,,--> reduce value
,,The loading relationships require more
,,overshoot
,,--> increase value
First phase step width,22.5 degrees,
First phase waiting time after step,150 ms,Decay behavior of the system:
,,Long settling time --> increase value
,,Short settling time --> reduce value
Second phase current level,Stationary current in %,
Second phase ramp up time,500 ms,
Second phase duration,3000 ms,
Error monitoring (range of motion),90 degrees,Application only permits very limited
,,uncontrolled changes in the movement
,,--> reduce value
,,The system has a small amount of
,,attenuation
