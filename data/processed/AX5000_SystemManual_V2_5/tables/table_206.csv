DANGER
"High voltage â€“ Danger of death!Due to the DC link capacitors, the DC link terminal points ""ZK+ and ZK- (DC+ and DC-)"" and ""RB+ andRB-"" may be subject to dangerous voltages of up to 875 VDC, even after the servo drive was disconnectedfrom the mains supply.Wait 5 minutes for the AX5101 - AX5125 and AX520x; 15 minutes for the AX5140/AX5160/AX5172; 30minutes for the AX5190/AX5191; 45 minutes for the AX5192/AX5193 after disconnecting, and measure thevoltage at the DC link terminal points ""ZK+ and ZK- (DC+ and DC-)"". The device is safe once the voltagehas fallen below 50 V."
