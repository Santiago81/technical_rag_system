,,"AX2090-MD50-0012motor choke for AX5000 (1.5...12 A),necessary for motor cable ≥ 25 m, up to 12A rated current, necessary for motor cable ≥25 m, max. 100 m, with integratedconnection cable (150 mm)","A motor choke must be installed betweenthe AX5000 and the motor from a certainmotor cable length onwards. The motorchoke reduces the commutation currentflowing via the screen back into the AX5000to a permissible value and can also providea solution to EMC problems."
