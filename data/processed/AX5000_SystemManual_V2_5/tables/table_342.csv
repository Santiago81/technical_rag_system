DANGER
"Serious risk of injury through electric shock!Due to the DC link capacitors dangerous voltage (> 890VDC) may persist at the DC link contacts “ZK+ andZK- (DC+ and DC-)“ and “RB+ and RB-“ after the servo drive has been disconnected from the mains sup-ply. After disconnecting the servo drive wait at AX5101 - AX5125 and AX520x; 5 minutes, at AX5140/AX5160/AX5172; 15 minutes, at AX5190/AX5191; 30 minutes and at AX5192/AX5193; 45 minutes andmeasure the voltage at the DC link contacts ZK+ and ZK- (DC+ and DC-). The device is safe once the volt-age has fallen below 50 V."
