NOTE
"Nature and source of the dangerThe setting ""0: No commutation position"" is intended to prevent an axis being inadvertently activated andthen moving in an unforeseeable manner or ""running away"". If not already done, it is essential after thechange to determine a valid commutation offset before the axis is activated (enabled)."
