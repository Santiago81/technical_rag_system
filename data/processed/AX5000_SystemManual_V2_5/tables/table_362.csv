DANGER
"Serious risk of injury through electric shock!Only staff qualified and trained in electrical engineering are allowed to wire up the brake resistors.•Check the assignment of the servo drive and the brake resistor. Compare the rated voltage and therated current of the devices.•Always make sure that the brake resistors are de-energized during assembly and wiring, i.e. no voltagemay be switched on for any piece of equipment which is to be connected. Ensure that the control cabinetremains turned off (barrier, warning signs etc.). The individual voltages will only be turned on again dur-ing commissioning.•Due to the DC link capacitors, the DC link contacts ""ZK+ and ZK- (DC+ and DC-)"" and ""RB+ and RB-""may be subject to dangerous voltages exceeding 890VDC, even after the servo drive was disconnectedfrom the mains supply.Wait 5 minutes for the AX5101 - AX5125 and AX520x; 15 minutes for the AX5140/AX5160/AX5172; 30minutes for the AX5190/AX5191; 45 minutes for the AX5192/AX5193 after disconnecting, and measurethe voltage at the DC links ""ZK+ and ZK- (DC+ and DC-)"". The device is safe once the voltage has fallenbelow 50 V."
