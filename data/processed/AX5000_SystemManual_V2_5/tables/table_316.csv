,AX5701-0000,"encoder option card for one additionalencoder input 1 Vpp, BiSS B, Hiperface,EnDat","The optional encoder card enables con-nection of an additional feedback sys-tems per channel. The system parame-ters match the standard parameters thatare analyzed via inputs X11 and X21.Through simple configuration viajumpers up to six further digital inputs(In ""A"" to In ""F"") can be analyzed, whichare provided through special feedbacksystems via parameter channels. TheX41 and X42 sockets are compatiblewith the plugs of the X11 and X21 frontsockets of the AX5000, which meansthat the tried and tested cables from theZK4510 series can be used. To analyzethe additional digital inputs you simplyhave to insert an adapter or establish asuitable wiring."
