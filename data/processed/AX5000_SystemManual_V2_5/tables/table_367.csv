"Normal operating range,","Permitted operating range,","Inadmissible operating range,"
max. 130%,max. 160%,more than 160%
This operating range is recommended for,"This operating range is still permitted, al-",In this operating range there is a risk of de-
maximum service life and error-free opera-,though it results in shorter service life with,struction of the brake resistor through over-
tion.,higher failure probability,heating. Due to the high temperatures the
,,adjacent components are also at risk.
