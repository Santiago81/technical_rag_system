DANGER
"Caution - Danger of death!Even when the AX5000 is disconnected from the mains voltage, dangerous voltage continues to be presentat the ""X02"" terminals of the DC link for at least 5 minutes. Wait until the DC link capacitors are dischargedbefore touching live terminals. The voltage measured between the DC+ and DC- terminals (X02) must havedropped to below 50 V."
